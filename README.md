# Image to Cartoon Image using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to convert regular images into cartoon-like images. The process involves several image processing techniques to achieve the cartoon effect.

## Features

- Image smoothing
- Edge detection
- Color quantization
- Cartoon effect application

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sujan22359/image-to-cartoon-image-using-openCV.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
    ```bash
    cd image-to-cartoon-image-using-openCV
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Place your input images in the `input_images` directory.
2. Run the script
    ```bash
    python cartoonize.py
    ```
3. The cartoonized images will be saved in the `output_images` directory.
